What is the Pre-trained Model?
A pre-trained model has been previously trained on a data set and contains the weights that represent the features of whichever data set it was trained on. Learned features are often transferable to different data.

Convolutional neural networks (CNN) are computing systems inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains. Such systems learn (progressively improve their ability) to do tasks by considering examples, generally without task-specific programming. For example, they might learn to identify images that contain cats analyzing example images that have been manually labeled as “cat” or “no cat” and using the analytic results to identify cats in other images. Labelling typically takes a set of unlabelled data and augments each piece of that unlabelled data with meaningful tags that are informative.

THESE ARE THE STEPS:

Data Collection-
Knowing Your Data first step can take you unprecedented heights in achieving the desired accuracy of predicted results.

Data Cleaning-
We want to prepare a homogeneous input data set to avoid chances of the model getting biased towards certain micro category.

Label Loading-
As the name suggests, it’s a process for manipulating the data load on our labels in such a manner that each of the labels’ images count reaches a comparable level.

Training the model-

Testing the model-

NOTE:

With both the above methods we can train a very good performance classifier using relatively less amount of data and much faster as well.

We can also experiment with ensemble networks to see if the performance can be improved.
